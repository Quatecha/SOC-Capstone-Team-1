# SOC Analysts

Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts play a vital role in the digital protection of organizations from cyber criminals.
Their primary role is monitoring and detecting anomalies in the network. They work to respond to and mitigate threats around the clock.

These security operations teams stand between the organization’s resources and bad actors.
They protect invaluable assets such as customer data, personnel data, business systems, intellectual property, business systems, brand integrity, etc.
SOC teams are the implementation component of a hopefully robust cyber security framework.

SOCs rely on the use of SIEM, IDS/IPS, Firewalls, logs, programs, scripts, and other technologies to assist in their efforts to detect and defend against threats.
They need to stay up-to-date with recent security vulnerabilities, exploits and malware. 
They prevent threats through methods such as gathering intelligence on latest threats, threat actors, and their TTPs:  Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures.

In the case of a confirmed security incident, SOC teams must collaborate with other teams to contain the incident as much as possible. They mitigate the threat as much as possible, so that it causes the least amount of damage to the company’s CIA Triad:  Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability.
