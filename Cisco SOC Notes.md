- A SOC is the first line of defense in preventing and responding to IT security breaches.
- Each member of a SOC team has a specific role with a specific skill set
  - Tier 1 Analyst: The triage specialist who must determine whether the alert is justified or simply a false positive.
  - Tier 2 Analyst: The incident handler does an in-depthassessment to understand the scope of the attack and identify the affected systems. 
  - Tier 3 Analyst: Threat hunter or incident responder is the most experienced member of the SOC operation team.
